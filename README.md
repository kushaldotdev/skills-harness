# skills-harness

Testbed for a vendored + wrapped agent-skills pack on pi: Matt Pocock's
[mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (engineering
lifecycle) combined with poteto's
[pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/skills) (per-task
rigor), orchestrated by a new `rigor-mode` conductor skill.

## Design rule: minimum changes to upstream

- `vendors/` holds **pristine upstream copies, trimmed to the skill buckets we
  use** (Matt: `engineering` + `productivity`; pstack: `skills/`). Never edit
  anything in `vendors/`. Upgrading = re-clone upstream at the pin, copy the
  same subset, then diff (the `.git` dirs were stripped, so upgrades re-clone
  rather than pull).
- `.agents/skills/` holds **wrappers** and **forks**:
  - **Wrapper** (most Matt skills): a thin SKILL.md that says "read and follow
    the vendored upstream SKILL.md", plus a short list of pi-only overrides
    (e.g. translate Cursor's "Call the Skill tool with X" into "read
    `vendors/.../X/SKILL.md`"). No upstream content is rewritten.
  - **Fork** (poteto ports that assume Cursor): content copied and genuinely
    edited for pi. Every deviation logged in `CHANGES.md`.
  - **New** (ours): `rigor-mode` conductor, generated verification skills.
- Every deviation from upstream — override or fork edit — is logged in
  [`CHANGES.md`](./CHANGES.md). If it isn't logged, it doesn't exist.

## The pack (24 finalized skills)

All live in `.agents/skills/`; every one traces to a vendor row in `CHANGES.md`.

### New — ours

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rigor-mode` | The conductor. Point it at a GitHub issue, a feature description, a markdown file of work items, or a seam/PR review range; it routes through the skills below, fans out pi `subagent` children, enforces size tiers (S/M/L), checkpoint barriers, and one-way-door autonomy gates. Tracker-optional. |

### Wrappers — thin delegation to vendored Matt Pocock skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tdd` | Test-driven red-green-refactor loop; seam questions before code. |
| `code-review` | Review a diff on two axes (standards + spec) via two parallel read-only reviewer children. |
| `diagnosing-bugs` | Diagnosis loop for hard bugs and perf regressions: reproduce, isolate, root-cause, prove the fix. |
| `domain-modeling` | Build and sharpen `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs as the domain model crystallizes. |
| `grill-with-docs` | Relentless interview to sharpen a plan, writing ADRs/glossary as it goes. |
| `implement` | Implement a spec or ticket set end to end (tdd at seams, code-review at close). |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | Scan for deep-module opportunities, present as visual report, grill the pick. |
| `prototype` | Throwaway prototype to answer a design question before committing. |
| `research` | Investigate a question against primary sources, capture findings as a repo doc. |
| `to-spec` | Synthesize the current conversation into a spec published to the tracker. |
| `to-tickets` | Break a plan/spec into tracer-bullet tickets with blocking edges on the tracker. |
| `triage` | Move issues/PRs through triage roles; verify, grill, write agent-ready briefs. |
| `wayfinder` | Plan multi-session work as a map of decision tickets; resolve the frontier one at a time. |
| `codebase-design` | Deep-module vocabulary: interfaces, seams, deletion tests. |
| `setup-matt-pocock-skills` | One-time repo config: tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout. |
| `grilling` | Stress-test a plan or decision with rounds of yes-shaped questions. |

### Forks — pstack skills edited for pi

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `interrogate` | Adversarial review: 4 persona reviewers (skeptic, bug hunter, contract breaker, simplifier) attack the change; synthesized verdict. |
| `blast-radius` | Find what a change breaks beyond the diff; prove the one safety fact by running real code. |
| `correct` | Mine the repo's repeated agent mistakes and make each one impossible (architecture > types > lint > test). |
| `benchmark-checklist` | 7-question vetting before trusting any perf number you measured. |
| `show-me-your-work` | TSV decision trail for long/unattended runs; audit against git evidence; fresh-context reviewer flags. |
| `create-verification-skill` | Generate a repo-local `verify-<app>` skill that drives the real app: Playwright + curl + DB CLI + screenshots read back as images. |
| `unslop` | Strip AI-writing tells from prose surfaces. |

```

## Testing

```bash
cd ~/projects/skills-harness
pi          # skills in .agents/skills/ auto-load for this cwd
```

## Installing into a repo (e.g. kalgo)

Copy what the target repo needs from `.agents/skills/` into the repo's
`.agents/skills/`, and harness-generic skills into `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
(global). The split decided so far:

| Destination | Skills |
|---|---|
| Repo `.agents/skills/` | `rigor-mode`, all wrappers, forks that touch repo surfaces |
| Global `~/.pi/agent/skills/` | `grilling`, `handoff` (existing global skill), `subagent-orchestration-policy`; plus generic wrappers if shared across projects |
| Repo-only, Kalgo-specific | `codebase-memory`, `postgres-query`, `redis-inspect` (stay in kalgo, not here) |

## Upgrading upstream

```bash
# refresh a vendor (no .git kept, so re-clone and diff)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mattpocock/skills /tmp/mp-fresh
diff -r /tmp/mp-fresh/skills/engineering vendors/mattpocock/skills/engineering
# then: copy the new subset in, and re-verify every CHANGES.md row against
# the new upstream text; wrappers make this a small check.
```

## Vendor contents

Verbatim skill copies, trimmed to used buckets; `.git` stripped, upstream
`LICENSE` kept for attribution, bucket READMEs kept:

| Vendor | Kept | Dropped |
|---|---|---|
| mattpocock/skills | `skills/engineering/` (20 skills), `skills/productivity/` (7 skills), bucket READMEs, `LICENSE` | `deprecated/`, `in-progress/`, `misc/`, docs, scripts, CI, plugin manifests |
| poteto/pstack | `skills/` (51), `LICENSE` | `README.md`, docs, `.gitignore` |

| Vendor | Ref | Date |
|---|---|---|
| mattpocock/skills | `49dd158d1076134a641b33efb035946536778336` (v1.3.1) | 2026-10-09 |
| cursor/plugins (pstack) | `d73344bee8cf22e53b9d5f4cf5749d38ba38c174` | 2026-10-09 |
