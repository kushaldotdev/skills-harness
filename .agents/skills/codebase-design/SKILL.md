name: codebase-design
description: Shared vocabulary for designing deep modules. Use when the user wants to design or improve a module's interface, find deepening opportunities, decide where a seam goes, make code more testable or AI-navigable, or when another skill needs the deep-module vocabulary.

# codebase-design (wrapper)

Read and follow `vendors/mattpocock/skills/engineering/codebase-design/SKILL.md` in full, then work under these overrides:

- Where the upstream skill says "Call the Skill tool with `X`", read and follow `vendors/mattpocock/skills/engineering/X/SKILL.md` instead (pi has no Skill tool; skills load by reading their SKILL.md).
- Where it references subagents, use the pi `subagent` tool under the ceilings in the `subagent-orchestration-policy` skill.

Anything not listed here: upstream text is authoritative. Deviations are logged in `CHANGES.md`; add any new one you notice there.
